From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marimo">Wikipedia</a> 

Aegagropila linnaei, better known as ball algae, is a multicellular green algae belonging to the Cladophoraceae family, widespread in the Northern Hemisphere.

Called in Japanese Marimo (毬藻 - Mari-Mo meaning "ball Mari" and Mo generally indicating water plants), it is also known as Cladophora, stone-plant, or ball algae. The name refers to the typical shape of these algae, which when grown form large green spheres with a velvety surface.
Colonies of these spheres are known only from Iceland, Japan, and from Siberia to Estonia, while they have been introduced by humans to Australia.
